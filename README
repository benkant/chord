Chord implementation in C

This implements the Chord algorithm based on the following paper:
Stoica, Ion et al. (2001). "Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applications". Proceedings of SIGCOMM'01 (ACM Press New York, NY, USA)

This implementation does not operate in a network environment and is a simulation.

The simulation requirements are to use an 8-bit keyspace, so a very simple hashing function is used. To use a larger keyspace it would be trivial to swap out the hash function with something like SHA.
